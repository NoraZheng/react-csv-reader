# CSV Reader

This is a React CSV Reader. Once you upload a .csv file, you can choose how many rows to display per page, and sort by column in ascending or descending order.

The app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses [react-csv-reader](https://norazheng.github.io/react-csv-reader/) by [Nicola Zambello](https://github.com/nzambello)
